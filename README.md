# Excel-for-Data-Analysis
A repository of Excel workbooks for practicing data analysis, reporting, and visualization with real and synthetic datasets.
I worked with four CSV datasets, cleaning, editing, and visualizing the data, and ultimately consolidating the project into its final form in .xlsx format. This process allowed me to analyze performance more effectively.
Here’s a polished GitHub profile / project description you can use to highlight your work on the “Case Study: Net Revenue Management in Excel” from DataCamp:

 Project1: Net Revenue Management (Excel Case Study)

I completed DataCamp’s “Case Study: Net Revenue Management in Excel” — a hands-on analytical project where I explored how businesses can manage net revenue more effectively using Excel tools and modeling.
What I did in this project:
* Investigated revenue data, including discounts, returns, costs, and net revenue drivers
* Built dynamic Excel workbooks to compute and compare gross revenue vs. net revenue
* Created aggregate tables and key metrics (e.g. revenue retention, margin impact, cost allocations)
* Designed PivotTables to break down net revenue performance by product, region, or customer segment
* Developed dashboards in Excel that summarize net revenue trends and highlight areas of concern or opportunity
* Used Excel features like calculated fields, conditional formatting, scenario analysis (what-if), data validation, and charts
What I gained from it:
* Strengthened my financial modeling skills in Excel — specifically around revenue analysis
* Learned how to incorporate costs, discounts, and returns into a holistic net revenue framework
* Improved my ability to convert raw financial data into actionable insights for business stakeholders
* Built competency in designing clear, interactive Excel reports and dashboards

Here’s a possible GitHub profile description section you could use (or adapt) to highlight your work on that DataCamp churn-analysis project:

Project 2:Customer Churn Analysis (Excel Case Study)

I completed [DataCamp’s “Case Study: Analyzing Customer Churn in Excel”](https://www.datacamp.com/completed/statement-of-accomplishment/course/3a4f049166a69094f2be9219444c65e2f0492304) — a hands-on project where I took a hypothetical telecom dataset (Databel) and drilled into churn metrics using Excel.

What I did in this project:
* Explored the dataset to understand customer behavior and patterns contributing to churn
* Created calculated fields and aggregate tables (e.g. churned customers, total customers, churn rate)
* Built multiple PivotTables to break down churn by state, account length, international plan status, and more
* Designed a dashboard (“Overview” sheet) that highlights key KPIs and visualizes churn drivers
* Used filtering, sorting, grouping, and conditional formatting to refine insights
What I gained from it:
* Deepened my Excel modeling skills (PivotTables, calculated fields, dynamic dashboards)
* Learned how to translate raw data into a clear narrative to present to stakeholders
* Practiced data-driven reasoning — not just what the churn rate is, but why it occurs
* Strengthened my ability to build maintainable and insightful reporting tools
