# Excel-for-Data-Analysis
A repository of Excel workbooks for practicing data analysis, reporting, and visualization with real and synthetic datasets.
I worked with four CSV datasets, cleaning, editing, and visualizing the data, and ultimately consolidating the project into its final form in .xlsx format. This process allowed me to analyze performance more effectively.
